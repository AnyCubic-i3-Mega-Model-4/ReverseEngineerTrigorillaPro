# Project Reverse Engineer Trigorilla Pro Board

The Trigorilla Pro board is the board that regulary comes with newer AnyCubic i3 Mega machines, and possibly others.

Hi, my board broke one stepper, AnyCubic said they are sending me one, so I've taken out mine
and decided to see what's there, sharing here what I've learned with everyone who wants.

## Organization

  - Guide.pptx -- you should start with this PowerPoint file (sorry, I don't even like PPT, but
  I realize it's some kind of file that pratically everyone can view and maybe edit even with
  3rd party software)

  - pictures/ -- the pictures of the board (copy of the ones on the guide)

  - schematics/ -- board physical schematics, I needed that because I'm making a braket,
  contains a DXF file, and a PNG render of the said DXF file in case you don't have a DXF reader
